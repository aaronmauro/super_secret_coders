# super_secret_coders

A code repo for playing with code with my kid. We like snek_case.

My son is five and just learning to type, but he understands programming concepts like variables, lists, functions, and loops. We started reading the [Secret Coders](http://www.secret-coders.com/) books from the library. I showed him that the turtle programs in the book actually worked in the Python Interpreter on the [Python home page](https://www.python.org/). We started writing [Turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html/) scripts in a text editor. He's hooked! So we set up a 7 year old Lenovo running. Linux for him. It has a touch screen and a stylus, which he likes [Tux Paint](http://www.tuxpaint.org/). We'll update as we go, so check back soon!
